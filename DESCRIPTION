Description: Designed to simplify and streamline the process of reading
    and processing large volumes of data in R. With a collection of
    functions tailored for bulk data operations, the package allows users
    to efficiently read multiple sheets from 'Microsoft Excel'/'Google
    Sheets' workbooks and multiple CSV files from a directory.  It returns
    the data as organized data frames, making it convenient for further
    analysis and manipulation. Whether dealing with extensive data sets or
    batch processing tasks, 'bulkreadr' empowers users to effortlessly
    handle data in bulk, saving time and effort in data preparation
    workflows.
