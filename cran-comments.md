## New version

This is a new version submission. In this version we developed two new functions namely:

- `generate_dictionary()`: This function is designed to automatically create a comprehensive data dictionary from labelled datasets. The generated dictionary provides detailed insights into each variable, aiding in better data understanding and management.

- `look_for()`: This enhances the capability to efficiently search within labelled datasets. It allows users to quickly find variable names and their descriptions by searching for specific keywords. This feature streamlines data exploration and analysis, particularly in large datasets with extensive variables.
