In this resubmission I have:

- used undirected single quotation marks in the description e.g. "bulreadr" --> 'bulkreadr' and Microsoft Excel --> 'Microsoft Excel'

- added \value to .Rd files and explained the functions results in the documentation for aliases.Rd and pipe.Rd.

## R CMD check results
